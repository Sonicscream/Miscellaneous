## halo-query.py

This script was my attempt at fetching data from my previously hosted Halo Custom Edition servers through a python program.

## aceofspades-serverlist.html

This file is the product of my **previous** lack of experience in using jQuery and fetching json data from an external source. It displays a table containing all the currently online servers for the game Ace of Spades (version 0.75 delivered by buildandshoot.com, not the steam version by Jagex that is now dead, or the copyright infringing roblox rip off version that needs to die). The master server is currently hosted by the group "Build and Shoot". Preview at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sonicscream/miscellaneous/aceofspades-serverlist.html.
